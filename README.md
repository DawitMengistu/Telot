## ‚ùì Is It Reliable?

Telegram bots can request a user‚Äôs phone number directly ‚Äî and it‚Äôs the same number tied to their Telegram account. This gives you a reliable, up-to-date contact without relying on weak or spoofable methods.

Unlike WhatsApp (which lacks bot APIs for verified phone retrieval), Telegram is built to allow secure, direct number access through bots. It‚Äôs more dependable than third-party SMS and even used by companies that send OTPs over Telegram as a fallback.
